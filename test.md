My name is Jay Berg and like many of you I have been playing Fantasy Football since the 1990s. Back then we used magazines for rankings and calculated Fantasy Points by hand from newspapers. Fantasy Football has come a long way, from the hobby of a special kind of nerdy stat geek, to now where Fantasy earnes more revenue than the NFL itself! 

One of the popular weekly fantasy football podcasts, has some of the most skilled and experienced High Stakes Fantsy Football players on as guests. They has the same question of each guest. 
> “When not playing fantasy football, what do you do for a living”? 

I gringe when I hear this. Shouldnt the top players in a 50 billion dollar fantasy football economy be playing fantasy football for a living?

As veteran fantasy football players, we know how hard it is to win, and even the best can go years without a championship team. 


When it comes to season-long, it’s a problem of variance. With season-long contests most of the winnings go to the championship winners. Even the best players may only win 1 out of 5 years, making it impractical to support you and your family. 

### Should the Barry Sanders on Fantasy Football not get paid since he has  ot won the championship? 

Imagine asking a Barry Sanders or Larry Fitzgerald. "When not playing NFL football, what do you do for a living?" 



In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin software, and anyone who downloaded and ran the software would start earning free bitcoin! 

> I would tell everyone:  "Run bitcoin software, its Free Money". But most just looked at me like I was crazy. One day at a friends apartment, I forced him to download and run bitcoin on his gaming computer.
>
> 8 years later I received a call from that friend. He wanted me to confirm if he has 25 real bitcoins. He was amazed when I told him **"Not only is it real, but they are now worth $500,000!"**

### There is a short period of time in any blockchain where early adopters get paid like startup founders!  

> With blockchain, the rule of thumb is to *"jump in first, and ask question later"*. Follow this rule only if 1. the software is open source 2. you are not asked to provide any identification, including an email address 3. never "jump in", if you are asked for any money or fees. 

**This is where we are now with Protoblock and Fantasybit**
