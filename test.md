title: An Open Letter To The Fantasy Football Community
subtitle: “When not playing fantasy football, what do you do for a living?”

My name is Jay Berg and like many of you I have been playing Fantasy Football since the 1990s. Back then we used magazines for rankings and calculated Fantasy Points by hand from newspapers. Fantasy Football has come a long way, from the hobby of a special kind of nerdy stat geek, to generating more revenue than the NFL itself! 

Each week I listen to a popular fantasy football podcasts. They asked the same question to their guests, who are some of the most skilled and experienced High Stakes Fantsy Football players. 
> “When not playing fantasy football, what do you do for a living”? 

I cringe when I hear this. Shouldn't the top players in a 27 billion dollar fantasy football economy be playing fantasy football professionally for a living? 

As veteran fantasy football players, we know how hard it is to win. Even the best players can go years without a championship team. Playing season-long Fantasy Football professionally full-time is just not possible.  *For a deep dive into why this is the case, see my 2016 paper - ProtoblockOpportunity.pdf*  

#### Should the Barry Sanders of Fantasy Football not get paid just because he has not won a championship?

> "When not playing NFL football, what do you do for a living?" 

We love Fantasy Football, its a unique multi-player game of skill with a social component. You can keep in touch with old friends, and make new ones. Fantasy twitter is alive with heated debate, yet it remains civil. In Fantasy Football, most debates are settled one way or another with each weeks games and each seasons totals. In contrast to my other community, Crypto Twitter, where the debates are continuous and have become nasty and personal. 

The current game evolved from the early internet days, with Commissioner.com, RotoWire, RotoWorld, WCOFF, FSTA, Podcasts, ScottFish, and Pros-vs-Joes. Experts have found new ways to monetize their skill and knoledge, by providing content: Articles, projections, youtube, twitter, and paid subscriptions.

*Then came DFS - but will leave that for another day*

### Just as we evolved from Newspapers to the Internet, I beleive the next evolution will be from the Internet to the Blockchain 

** PROTOBLOCK – Professional Rotisserie Blockchain ** is a system with a set of rules. Each user runs the system locally on their computer, and connects to each-other in a peer-to-peer distributed network. 

* Protolbock will NOT kill the experts business models
* Protoblock will NOT replace data providers
* Protolbock does NOT compete with season-long or DFS game providers 
* Protoblock is NOT Fantasy Football 
* No Teams

Protoblock has the potential to double the Fantasy Football economy
Protoblock has no business model 

Protoblock IS a public utility for the Fantasy Football Player 
Protoblock IS controled by fantasy football players 
Protoblock IS a system designed to create new value
Protoblock IS The Origional Football Blockchain - since 2014 

Protoblock is the begining of an evolution, a revolution that puts Fantasy Football back into the control of the community itself, with no central authority. It has the potential to solve many companies legal and payment processing issues. It can eliminate DFS insider information. Provide free,  accurate, real-time, last-minute, start/sit advice. Accuratly price dynasty trade values. Enable Fantasy Football players to monetize all their skills, including predicing busts. It can democritize fantasy celebrity. 

** Protoblock has the potential enable hundreds of thousands of season-long veterans to become full-time professionals, earning a living doing what they love. **

*Protoblock is 100% free. Protoblock users may remain anonynous. Protoblock is a self-fullfilling prophecy.*

** There is no free lunch - you already paid with 20+ years acquiring Fantasy Football Skill **

Protoblock requires individual action, individual responsibility, and individual attention. Protoblock requires community and consensus. Protoblock requires early-adopters to trust the process before its obvious, while climbing a steep learning curve, with potential rewards of fantasy fame and fortune at the end.  

** We WONT ask for money, we WONT ask for your name, we WONT ask for your email address. We WILL pay you for your attention to football. We WILL provide Windows and Mac Fantasy Desktop Wallet Software with schedules, player info, projections, and results, as well as Android and iOS companion Apps. We are the decentralized protoblock developers ** 

## Whos in?  
Welcome to the first decentralized fantasy football community. Its currently week 9 of 2018 season, there are 7 weeks left and there will be around 22,000 PPR points scored through week 16. This means there are 2,200,000 Fantasybit coins up for grabs, valued at around $200,000! (will explain below), but first lets get you your coins. 

1. Download Protoblock (desktop preferred)
2. Claim your name (chose twitter handle ot fantsy team name or remain anonymous) 
>With BLockchain there is no login with a name and password, as there is no central company or server to log into. Instead each users machine creates a Public / Private key pair. This public key is your identity and the private key is kept secret.  

3. Write down your secret. (or skip now and export secret later)
4. Make Week 9 PPR Projections on 1 or all players  
    *  First Copy Average or Drag Drop and Copy from another Fantasy Name
    *  Hit Send
    *  Now feel free to make individual changes 
    *  Try export/import CSV file 
    *  Contact us for custom connection to any APIs     
>This is not really a competition with your fellow fantasy experts, since all your projections are instantly public. Rather its a community effort to widley distrubted coins amoung all NFL knoledge and Fantasy Football skill. 

** Come back after each game to see how many coins you earned.Projections are open through week 16 and then again week 1 for 2019 **  

## Rules  
1. Each PPR point scored in the NFL from week1 to week16 generates 100 Fantasybit
    * 1 Fantasy Point = 100 Fantasybit  
2. All Fantasybit are split amoung users with qualifying accurate projections, the more accurate your projection the more Fantasybit awarded. 

**Fantasybit - The PPR Coin - is a token of fantasy football Skill**

Each users software independently keeps a ledger of all users and all projections. Everyone independatly runs the numbers, follows the rules and keeps score.  

> Example: Tom Brady scored 20 Fanasypoints, this equals 2000 Fantasybits – if 100 users projected 20 each user gets 20 Fantasypoints 

----
As a thought experiment, imagine a 12 team high-stakes league, where each person in the league downloads desktop software that connects to each other.  All draft picks, waiver moves, lineups, is sent to the other 11 teams computers. Each user "brings his own" NFL stats data. Since your computer knows all the league settings and scoring rules, it will idpependatly score each game, each week, and crown the same Champion at end of season. 

For this to work, the stats data must all be the same. Consensus must be reached on the NFL data. As we will see below, this consenus is the core of the Protoblock system.

Now, all that is left is to payout the winners.  

*Question: Why cant we have 100% payouts? What do current fantasy game companies give us in return for fees?* 

*Answer: Companies provide safe keeping of funds though escrow and provide payouts to winners.* 

**Bitcoin and Blockchain are the final piece to the internet puzzle – a trustless to transfer value without the need for escrow or a central authority**

So instead of using a Company for payouts, we can created a virtual currency that is native to our little 12 node network. As soon as the season is over, each machine will automatically update a ledger and assign the winnings accordingly. 

This idea applies to all indistries companies, banks, casinos, etc. Take away any fees, or revenue from almost any product or service, and instead create a virtual currency, that is required to be used as payment for the product or service. 

The hard part would be converting this made-up virtual currency to Dollars ot groceries. For it to have real value, it must become "hard money". It must be scarce, censorship resistant, with an immutible ledger, and have real utility.  
----------
*Bitcoin with Proof-of-Work (POW) was the first real "hard money" Cryptocurrency. Fantasbit with Proof-of-Skill has a similar potential*

>Has hard as it is to understand bitcoin. Trust me when I tell you, its just as hard for bitcoiners to understand Fantasy! 

Bitcoin is a system of aligning economic incentives – every 10 minutes a bitcoin miner, usually located in China is awarded $100,000 just for finding a virtual needle in a cirtual haystack. The one who finds this needle becomes central authority for this “Block”. Every 10 minutes a new random authorty is chosen. This creates the sensorship resistance property and enables bitcoin to reach consensus and prevent double-spend. 

Why are billions of dollars spent finding needles in haystacks? Because they are being paid for it. Incentives are economically aligned between miners and users. 

Bitcoin POW miners are searching for a single number, that when combines with the Block and put through a one-way SHA256 hash function solve a difficult random problem. Each bitcoin node has runs their own SHA256 on the block to confirm it. This is how the bitcoin creates a distributed ledger. 

POW is slow and some say it not environmentally friendly. However until now, there was no other way of independently agreeing on random data. 
---------

## We may be sitting on a gold mine 
Professional Sports is human phenonenon where major sporting events, like NFL football, are watched by 100s of millions of people at the same time. Billions of dollars on the line, from sports betting to fantasy. After the game this data is published in every newspaper, and broadcaated online. 

Billions of dollars in bets are settled, all without a central authority. *In fact, major sporting event data already has decentraized consensus!* 

We now have a second kind of random data, that "everyone" can independatly agree on, we can replace POW with Proof-of-Skill. 

Fantasy points results data from each NFL game already has consesus. We colectivly turn Fantasy points into Fantasybit coins, and then distribute them the collective Skill of the football community. Now every 40 seconds we have a lottery, where one random user with the winning ticket is the central authority and gets to create a block of transactions! 

---------
### Why would anyone pay us $200,000 for Fantsybit created out of thin air? 
Fantasybit has value from its "hard money" properties. They are scarce, hard to obtain, immutible, and has with real utility. 

* Scarcity comes from the number of Fantasy points scored in the NFL 

* Hard to obtain – right now, it’s easy to obtain, but at some point “mining” Fantasybit with Projections, will become a specialized endeavor for real knowledgeable NFL fans and skilled Fantasy Football players. As we all know Fantasy Football skill is hard to obtain. 

*10 years ago today Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin software, anyone who downloaded the software would be earning 100s of coins a day. Now it takes a huge multi-million dollar operation to mine a single bitcoin. The price of bitcoin went from $0 to a high of $19,9000, and is now trading at $65000.*

* Immutable comes from the fact that your balance cannot be changed. As long as you independatly verify that the NFL stats are correct, you can be sure that no cheating is possible. 

* Utility – Protoblock Trading Game is the current utility. However, one can imagine a Protoblock Casino charging 0% vigorish on spread bets, or Protoblock Season-Long or Protoblock DFS with 100% payouts. The only requiment would be all entries fees and bets but be made in Fantasybit. These utliities create the fundamental demand for the token, 

**Now Fantasybit takes on properties of “Hard Money”. Some investors would buy Fantasybit as a “Store of value” to hedge their stock portfolio. Other investors would buy to speculate on Fantasybit price rise due ot demand.** 

These buyers will pay bitcoin or even dollars for Fantasybit. Now guess who gets paid? The community of Fantasy Football Skill will get to sell their coins that they mined for free! It’s a WIN WIN! 

## Trading Game
The first utility for Fantasybit is not free DFS, free season-long, or NFL bettng betting with 100% payouts. 

** Decentralized Fantasy Forwards Market **

If and when your 2018 Fantasy teams are out, take a couple of minutes of your time, to download Protoblock and make projections. There is even an “easy button” where you can and should Copy other players projections. Then after each game see how many Fantasybits you have. Its not a competition between Fantasy Football players, rather its meant to be equally distributed amoung all Fantasy Football players – the more real fantasy players with coins the more robust the system would be.

When it comes to season-long, it’s a problem of variance. With season-long contests most of the winnings go to the championship winners. Even the best players may only win 1 out of 5 years, making it impractical to support you and your family. 




In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin software, and anyone who downloaded and ran the software would start earning free bitcoin! 

> I would tell everyone:  "Run bitcoin software, its Free Money". But most just looked at me like I was crazy. One day at a friends apartment, I forced him to download and run bitcoin on his gaming computer.
>
> 8 years later I received a call from that friend. He wanted me to confirm if he has 25 real bitcoins. He was amazed when I told him **"Not only is it real, but they are now worth $500,000!"**

### There is a short period of time in any blockchain where early adopters get paid like startup founders!  

> With blockchain, the rule of thumb is to *"jump in first, and ask question later"*. Follow this rule only if 1. the software is open source 2. you are not asked to provide any identification, including an email address 3. never "jump in", if you are asked for any money or fees. 

**This is where we are now with Protoblock and Fantasybit**
