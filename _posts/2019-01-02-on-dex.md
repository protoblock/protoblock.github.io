Decentralized Exchanges, _DEX_, are a hot topic in the bitcoin/blockchain community, with many touting them as the ultimate solution to enable global hyperbitcoinization. 

This post will go over the purpose and history of exchanges and show that merely removing centralized custody and settlement is not enough, and a true DEX is theoretically impossible, even when decentralized custody is completely solved. _Reality Arbitrage_ is presented as a possible solution, inspired by the invention of linked-timestamps, a precursor to the Bitcoin Blockchain.  

> With so many _DEX_ projects coming on-line, lets first ask: What is a _DEX_? It’s a Decentralized Exchange. So, what is an exchange?

# Exchange 
Say you are interested in buying Altcoin with ticker _ALT_. You are interested in owning _ALT_ itself, as an investor or user. In contrast to a trader, who does not care about owning _ALT_, but is just trading to earn more profits in Bitcoin. We will get to the trader in a bit. 

You are holding Bitcoin and want to purchase Altcoin; the price ticker is _ALTBTC_. To do this, you need to first find someone holding _ALT_ , who wants bitcoin, and is willing to sell it to you.  You can put adds on craigslist, ask friends, or post on social media. Better yet, what if there is a central place where everyone goes that wants to trade _ALTBTC_? 

**An Exchange, is like a marketplace, a physical or virtual place where like-minded people go to buy or sell **

One of the earliest "exchanges" was the Tontine Coffee House in New York City, in the late 1700s, which later became the New York Stock Exchange. Even at a designated exchange, finding a seller with the right quantity and price can take all hours, days, weeks or months. Brokers saw a business opportunity, where for a commission, they will stay at the exchange all-day/ every day, watch the markets and find buyers or sellers to match your orders.

| *Bucket Shop, early 1900s* |

Bucket-Shops were are new kind of "exchange", where you can bet on stock prices, but never actuality bought or sold anything at all. One of first traders and most successful speculators of all-time, Jesse Lauriston Livermore, began trading at bucket shops, before becoming a professional wall street trader. _The book, [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf), is a fictional account of his life, and is a must read for anyone interested in the art of trading and speculation_.

## Traders vs Investors 

> We (investors) give them (traders) volatility with market orders, they (traders) give us (investors) liquidity with limit orders 
Traders, speculators, and market-makers will buy and sell any asset for the sole purpose of profiting by buying low and selling high. In one sense, traders get paid for providing liquidity to the true buyers, the investors or users. Advanced trading strategies emerged such as "short selling", where a trader would borrow stock from a broker, and then immediately sell it and hold on to the cash.  They would then wait for the price to drop, use some of the cash to buy it back, return the stock to the lender, and keep the remaining cash as profit! 

Investors are seeking liquidity, and traders are seeking profit, and neither one wants to take on the risk that the other side of the trade will default or renege. Hence the modern financial markets were born. 

Exchanges enable price-discovery by pooling buy and sell orders from investors, traders, and speculators, into a single “book” of liquidity. Orders are filled when bids and offers are matched at the desired price. When a trade is made, the exchange charges a fee, and broadcasts the price on a ticker feed. 
In addition, exchanges remove counter-party credit-risk, by taking custody and guaranteeing settlement and clearing. They achieved this by only allowing pre-qualified members of the exchange to trade on the exchange. Members would consist of mostly two groups, investment brokers and floor “specialists” traders. Brokers are the agents of the investors and would work in their best interest. While floor traders, where professionals seeking _Alpha_. 
## Alpha vs Beta
Beta is the returns from market movement of the underlying asset itself, while Alpha is the excessive returns that are independent of the underlying market price. Alpha reflects your net profit and loss from trading. Beta reflects your profit and loss in relation to an underlying asset. 
*An investor’s portfolio with 100% _ALT_, would have a Beta of 1 vs _ALT_.  
*A trader seeks _Alpha_, by buying and selling _ALT_ many times over and over, and would always be flat the close of each trading session. 
*A speculator seeks _Alpha_, by going long or short  _ALT_ _Beta_, and may hold for  days, weeks or longer.  
Exchanges volumes have always been dominated by _Alpha_ traders over _Beta_  investors. By the 80s and 90s, due to real-time computerized price feeds, and electric brokers, more volume was coming from traders and speculators than all investors combined.  Then in 1998, when the SEC authorized electronic exchanges, High Frequency Trading (HFT) was born, which took it to the next level. By 2017 over 90% of all trading volume will come from short term _Alpha_ strategies! [source](https://www.techstars.com/content/startup-digest/history-high-frequency-trading-hft-infographic/)

Modern exchanges mostly rely on _Alpha_ traders for profits,  and cater to their needs. While  _Alpha_ traders rely on the _Beta_ investors for trading profits. And _Beta_ investors rely on the _Alpha_ traders for liquidity. At the center, and the core technology in this eco-system is the "central limit order book". 
An exchange order book enables a fair and open efficient market, for optimal price discovery, and liquidity. It contains all open orders and is sorted first by price and then by time.

### Exchanges provide:
* Custody: Settlement and Clearing of trades, plus transfer of assets. This removes the need for buyers and sellers to trust each other.  
* Liquidity: Matching and Execution of trades, through a single central limit order book, enabling best execution and price discovery. 

# Decentralized Exchange
## Ultimate Goal 
An exchange that provides price discovery by matching buyers and sellers from a deep pool of liquidity with tranparency, immutibility, and censorship rsistance. Where buyers and sellers are open participants of the exchange, are always in custody of their own assets, and may remain psudo-anonymous. 

What does "Decentralized" mean in a DEX? 
* Decentralized Custody: Settlement and Clearing without a centralized custodian. 
* Decentralized Liquidity: Matching and Execution of trades through a decentralized limit order book. This requires the macthing engine to be distributed on each users machine. 

Most DEXs today are trying to solve the problem of settlement and clearing without centralized custody. This makes sense, because with  bitcoin we no longer always need a central authority for asset transfers.  However, without pooling liquity together, they are ignoring the needs of 99% of tranditional exchange volume. These DEXs are geared towards the investors and users, who are looking find buyers and sellers, and are  similar to OTC (Over-The-Counter) tradnig desks. OTC desks, privately match buyers and sellers at negotiated prices, which are independent of the current prices from the liquid exchanges. 

Decentralized custody is an almost impossible problem to solve, but with atomic swap technology many projects are almost there. There still are fundamental problems with these solutions, but we are not going to into those here. Becuase there is an even bigger problem, that we need to discuss. Decentralized Liquidity. 

Price discovery and liquity are the main purpose of any exchange. For a DEX to compete with a centralized exchange it must also create deep liquity by attracking algorithmic traders, who make up over 90% of volume. However decentralized limit-order books are impossible, due to _Adverse Selection Risk_ a.k.a front-running

> DEXs are only interesting if they can compete with centralized exchanges in providing deep liquidity. 

## Good News and Bad News
The good news is that decentralized custody, clearing, and settlement is already solved with blockchain. The bad news is:  even when decentralized custody, clearing, and settlement is completly solved, decentralized exchanges are still impossible!  

> An account based blockchain with more than a single asset, can have a native on-chain "exchange" with a limit order book. Users place buy and sell orders by signing special blockchain transactions. Each node has a complete matching-engine and limit-order book built in, and processes the buy and sell orders from the block of transactions. After each trade execution, each node will automatically debit and credit funds and assets from the buyers and sellers. 

* In fact, many blockchains already have decentralized matching engines i production! Such as, _XRP_, _Bitshares_, _Counterparty_, _Protoblock_, _Ethereum_, and _NXT_, to name a few. *

Of course this can only work with assets from inside the blockchain itself. 

## Adverse Selection Risk (ASR) 
The ability for miners to front-run yor orders, means that your orders only get filled when its not in your favor. Your adversaries are selectivly filling your orders, only when its profitable for them. 
 
"Central Limit Order Books" are path dependant, transaction ordering matters. Bitcoin and Proof-of-Work solve double-spend, which only requires miners to decide which tx goes into a block in case of a double spend. Transaction order inside a block has no effect on bitcoin UTXOs. Miners are free to order the transaction in any way. However transaction order is a fundamental property of exchange matching engines. 

In fact, the term "Central Limit Order Book", has been used since the 1980s, as exchanges quickly discovered that matching-engines need to be run on a single thread in a single computer. In fact, the reason for this is same Byzabteme Generals Problem solved by Bitcoin! 

## Front-Running 

### Flash Crash 

These 7 orders should go though the matching engine and produce the following. 

```javascript
1. trader1: Buy   5 at 500 
2. trader1: Sell  5 at 1500 
3. trader2: Buy   1 at 950
4. trader3: Sell  1 at 955
5. trader4: Sell  2 at 95 
6. trader1: Sell  1 at 940 
7. trader5: Buy   2 at 950 
```

![book11](/img/book11.png)
![book12](/img/book12.png)
![book13](/img/book13.png)
![book14](/img/book14.png)

Now lets see what happens if we just reorder transaction 5 and 7. 

```javascript
1. trader1: Buy   5 at 500 
2. trader1: Sell  5 at 1500 
3. trader2: Buy   1 at 950
4. trader3: Sell  1 at 955
5. trader5: Buy   2 at 950 
6. trader1: Sell  1 at 940 
7. trader4: Sell  2 at 95 
```

![book21](/img/book21.png)

* trader4 went from -45% to breakeven *
* trader1 went from flat with +845 profit to short 2 at 950 *

A change in a single transaction created a 45% in traders P&L. What if instead a miner did the following? 
```javascript
1.  trader1: Buy   5 at 500 
2.  trader1: Sell  5 at 1500 
4.  trader3: Sell  1 at 955
5.  miner:   Buy   2 at 501
6.  miner:   Sell  2 at 940 
7.  trader4: Sell  2 at 95 
8.  trader2: Buy   1 at 950
9.  trader1: Sell  1 at 940 
10. trader5: Buy   2 at 950 
```

![book31](/img/book31.png)


Long 2 at 501
Sell 2 at 950

Miner just made 889% in the trade, and is up $1690! and with no risk! 





miners only have the power to chose one side of a double spent.    

only solve 



> Decentralized liquity is impossible, becuase of front running.  

## A Possible Solution

### Aprouch 
Attracking the liquidity providers, the Alpha traders
solve the biggest problems of centralized exchanges

#### HFT creates Flash Crashes 
Although Investors and Exchanges relly on traders for price discovery and liquidity. The High Freaquency Alpha bots are cousing more harm than good. HFT is the main cause of flash crashes to begin with. Exchanges and regulators have been seeking ways to elimate the practice. 


A new decentralized exchange that eliminates HFT, thus removing the Flash Crash epidemic, while still retaining the Alpha "Position" Traders, is a tall order! 


### Inspiration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYr-keVOQ18

We take inspiration from the inventors of linked-timestaming, the precursor to the blockchain. Scott Stornetta and Steward Habor found it impossible to solve the problem of creating immutible digitial records, because anyone all those who had access could change it. And even a group of people in-charge of watching over the data could ultimatly collude. The solution was a "conspiracy so large that every one in the world must be in on it". This inverted the problem, by making the data widely distributed and public. 

### Inverting the problem  
Distributed Order-books are impossible, since there is no way to reach consensus on the order of the transactions. This gives each miner the ability to front-run, and take free money, causing adverse-slection risk to all traders at the exchange, which would kill liquidity and not compete with centralized systems. 

What if we look at this "front-running" as a block-reward? In normal blockchains, miner need to be incentivised with block-rewards. However, what if we make a new blockchain, where miners would have to pay to sign blocks? What are they paying for? They are paying for the right to re-order the blocks. 

We invert the problem of front-running, by making it a feature awarded to the highest bidder of each block! From the example above, how much would trader4 pay to go from -$855 to 0? He would pay up to $854. How much would tarder1 pay to NOT go from +855 to 0? He may pay up to $844! 

> invert the problem, by explictly letting anyone pay to front-run

## Reality Arbitrage 

Say this is the list and order of transactions for a block. 

How much would Trader1 pay to reorder blocks? The amount that he lost. 

How much would Trader2 pay to reorder blocks? The amount that he won. 

We called this Dimention or Reality Arbitrage, since you can change the past to a new reality. 

Implications. remove flash crash. remove hft? 

It took hundreds of years until every since drop of Alpha has been squeezed out of centralized exchanges, where HFT rules, and flash crashes are inevitable. 

> What is the new Alpha trading strategy with Reality Arbitrage in effect?  

If we are going to solve the DEX issues, it will have to be the blockchain way, a complete new paradigm for financial markets and exchanges. A new blockchain where you pay sign blocks, and the highest bidder gets to reorder the transactions, with the longest chain being the total cost of the chain. Does this seem like something that should be expored in more depth? Please contact me me via email or twitter to explore this idea even farther. Happy 2019!
