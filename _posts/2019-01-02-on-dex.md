Decentralized Exchanges (_DEX_), are a hot topic in the bitcoin community, with many touting them as the ultimate solution to enable global hyperbitcoinization. 

This post will go over the purpose and history of exchange. We will see that merely removing centralized custody and settlement is not enough, as a true _DEX_ is theoretically impossible even when assuming decentralized custody is completely solved. _Reality Arbitrage_ is presented as a possible solution, inspired by the invention of linked-timestamps, the precursor to the Bitcoin Blockchain.  

> With so many _DEX_ projects coming on-line, lets first ask: What is an exchange?

# Exchange 
Say you are interested in buying Altcoin with ticker _ALT_. You interest is in owning _ALT_ itself, either as an investor or a user. In contrast to a trader, who does not care about owning _ALT_, but is just trading to earn more profits in Bitcoin. 

You are holding Bitcoin and want to purchase Altcoin; the price ticker is _ALTBTC_. To do this, you need to first find someone holding _ALT_ , who wants bitcoin, and is willing to sell it to you.  You can put adds on craigslist, ask friends, or post on social media. Better yet, what if there is a "central" place where everyone goes that wants to trade _ALTBTC_? 

**An Exchange, is like a marketplace, a physical or virtual place where like-minded people go to buy or sell**

One of the earliest "exchanges" was the _Tontine Coffee House_ in New York City, in the late 1700s, which later became the New York Stock Exchange.

Even at a designated exchange, finding a seller with the right quantity and price can take hours, days, weeks or months. Brokers saw a business opportunity, where for a commission, they will stay at the exchange all-day, watch the markets, and find a sellers to match your buy price and quanity.

| *Bucket Shop, early 1900s* |

Bucket-Shops were are new kind of "exchange", where you can bet on stock prices, but never actuality bought or sold anything at all. One of first traders and most successful speculator of all-time, Jesse Lauriston Livermore, began at bucket shops, before becoming a professional floor trader on wall street. _The book, [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf), is a fictional account of his life, and is a must read for anyone interested in the art of trading and speculation_.

Advanced trading strategies emerged such as "short selling", where a trader would borrow stock, and immediately sell it. He would hold onto the cash, and wait for the price to drop. Then use some of the cash to buy it back, and return the stock to the lender. The trader  keeps the remaining cash, as profit! 

## Traders vs Investors 

> Investors give traders volatility with market orders, and traders give investors liquidity with limit orders.  

Traders, speculators, and market-makers will buy and sell any asset for the sole purpose of profiting by buying low and selling high. In one sense, traders get paid for providing liquidity to the true buyers, the investors or Altcoin users. 

Investors are seeking liquidity, and traders are seeking profit, and neither one wants to take on the risk that the other side of the trade will default or renege. Hence the modern financial markets were born. 

Exchanges enable price-discovery by pooling buy and sell orders from investors, traders, and speculators, into a single “book” of liquidity. Orders are filled when bids and offers are matched at the desired price. When a trade is made, the exchange charges a fee, and broadcasts the price on a ticker feed. 

In addition, exchanges remove counter-party credit-risk, by taking custody and guaranteeing settlement and clearing. They achieved this by only allowing pre-qualified members of the exchange to trade on the exchange. Members would consist of mostly two groups, investment brokers and floor “specialists” traders. Brokers are the agents of the investors and would work in their best interest, while floor traders where professionals seeking _Alpha_. 

## _Alpha_ vs _Beta_
_Beta_ is the returns from market movement of the underlying asset price itself, while _Alpha_ is the excessive returns that are independent of the underlying market price. _Alpha_ reflects your net profit and loss from trading. _Beta_ reflects your profit and loss in relation to an underlying asset. 
* An investor’s portfolio with 100% _ALT_, would have a Beta of 1 vs _ALT_.  
* A floor trader seeks _Alpha_, by buying and selling _ALT_ many times over but would always be flat the close of each trading session. 
* A speculator seeks _Alpha_, by going long or short _ALT_ _Beta_, and may hold for  days, weeks or longer. 

Exchanges volumes have always been dominated by _Alpha_ traders over _Beta_  investors. By the 1980s and 90s, due to real-time computerized price feeds, and electric brokers, more volume was coming from traders and speculators than all investors combined.  Then in 1998, when the SEC authorized electronic exchanges, High Frequency Trading (HFT) was born, which took it to the next level. By 2017 over 90% of all trading volume will come from short term _Alpha_ strategies! [source](https://www.techstars.com/content/startup-digest/history-high-frequency-trading-hft-infographic/)

Modern exchanges mostly rely on _Alpha_ traders for profits,  and cater to their needs. While  _Alpha_ traders rely on the _Beta_ investors for trading profits. And _Beta_ investors rely on the _Alpha_ traders for liquidity. 

**At the center, and the core technology in the exchange eco-system is the _Central Limit Order Book_.**

Exchange order books create liquidity, and enables a fair and open efficient market for optimal price discovery. It contains all open orders and is sorted first by price and then by time. 

| ![limitorderbook](/img/limitorderbook.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Exchange Limit Orderbook* |

**Modern exchanges provide:**
* Liquidity: Matching and Execution of trades, through a single central limit order book, enabling best execution and price discovery.

* Custody: Settlement and Clearing of trades, plus transfer of assets. This removes the need for buyers and sellers to trust each other.

---

# _DEX_
## Ultimate Goal 
An exchange that provides price discovery by matching buyers and sellers from a deep pool of liquidity with transparency, immutability, and censorship resistance. Where buyers and sellers are open participants of the exchange, are always in custody of their own assets, and may remain pseudo-anonymous. 

**What does "Decentralized" mean in a DEX?** 
* Decentralized Liquidity: Matching and Execution of trades through a decentralized limit order book. This requires the matching engine to be distributed, and running on each users machine. 
* Decentralized Custody: Settlement and clearing without a centralized custodian. Users control their own asset, via private-keys.  


## Decentralized Custody 
Most _DEX_ projects today are only trying to solve the problem of settlement and clearing without centralized custody. This makes sense, because the main bitcoin innovation was removing the need for a central authority, when transferring digital value. However, without pooling liquidity together, they are ignoring 90% of traditional exchange volume! 

These _DEX_ are geared towards the individual investors and users, who are looking find peers to trade with, and are more similar to an Over-The-Counter (OTC) trading desk than to an Exchange! OTC desks privately match buyers and sellers at negotiated prices, which are independent of the current prices from the liquid exchanges. 

Decentralized custody is an almost impossible problem to solve, and projects like [_bisq_](https://bisq.network/) (for bitcoin to fiat), or atomic swaps (for bitcoin to altcoin), are almost there. While there still maybe fundamental problems with these solutions, we are not going to delve into those here. Instead, we will be assuming that decentralize custody is already solved, and discuss the even bigger problem; Decentralized Liquidity. 

**The good news is that decentralized custody, clearing, and settlement is already solved with blockchain. The bad news is, that even when decentralized custody, clearing, and settlement is completely solved, decentralized exchanges are still impossible!**  

## Custody solved "on-chain"  
> An account based blockchain with more than a single asset, can have a native on-chain "exchange" with a limit order book. Users place buy and sell orders by signing special blockchain transactions. Each node has a complete matching-engine and limit-order book built in, and processes the buy and sell orders from the block of transactions. After each trade execution, each node will automatically debit and credit funds and assets from the buyers and sellers. 

* In fact, many blockchains already have decentralized matching engines in production! Such as, _XRP_, _Bitshares_, _Counterparty_, _Protoblock_, _Ethereum_, and _NXT_, to name a few. *

_Of course this can only work with assets from inside the blockchain itself._

## Decentralized Liquidity 
> Price discovery and liquidity are the main purpose of any exchange. 

_DEX_ are only interesting if they can compete with centralized exchanges. For _DEX_ to compete with centralized exchanges, it must  provide deep liquidity for investors by attracting the short term _Alpha_ traders, who account for 90% of traditional exchange volume.

**An exchange must provide a matching engine and order book to fill the needs, and attract _Alpha_ traders. However decentralized limit-order books are impossible, due to _Adverse Selection Risk_ also knows as,  _front-running_**

### Adverse Selection Risk (ASR) 
The ability for miners to front-run orders, means that your orders only get filled when its not in your favor. "Your adversaries are selectively filling your orders, only when its profitable for them."

The problem is that matching-engines and order-books are path dependent. Meaning the transaction order within a block, matters. Bitcoin and Proof-of-Work solved double-spend, which only requires miners to decide which transaction to chose from in case of a double spend. Otherwise, miners are free to order the transaction in any way, since the order of transactions inside a block, has no effect. The same set of bitcoin transactions, in any order will create the same state data, or UTXO set. 

**The order of transactions, is a fundamental property of exchange matching engines, since order-books are sorted by time, orders are filled in FIFO order.**  

The term "Central Limit Order Book", has been used since the 1980s, when early exchanges quickly discovered that matching-engines cannot be distributed, and will only work when run on a single thread on a single server. **In fact, the reason for this is same Byzantine Generals Problem that was solved by Bitcoin!** 

### Miner Front-Running 

These 7 orders should go though the matching engine and produce the following. 

```javascript
1. trader1: Buy   5 at 500 
2. trader1: Sell  5 at 1500 
3. trader2: Buy   1 at 950
4. trader3: Sell  1 at 955
5. trader4: Sell  2 at 95 
6. trader1: Sell  1 at 940 
7. trader5: Buy   2 at 950 
```

![bookb](/img/bookb.png)


Now lets see what happens if we just reorder transaction 5 and 7. 

```javascript
1. trader1: Buy   5 at 500 
2. trader1: Sell  5 at 1500 
3. trader2: Buy   1 at 950
4. trader3: Sell  1 at 955
5. trader5: Buy   2 at 950 
6. trader1: Sell  1 at 940 
7. trader4: Sell  2 at 95 
```

![book21](/img/book21.png)

* trader4 went from -45% to breakeven *
* trader1 went from flat with +845 profit to short 2 at 950 *

A change in a single transaction created a 45% in traders P&L. What if instead a miner did the following? 
```javascript
1.  trader1: Buy   5 at 500 
2.  trader1: Sell  5 at 1500 
4.  trader3: Sell  1 at 955
5.  miner:   Buy   2 at 501
6.  miner:   Sell  2 at 940 
7.  trader4: Sell  2 at 95 
8.  trader2: Buy   1 at 950
9.  trader1: Sell  1 at 940 
10. trader5: Buy   2 at 950 
```

![book31](/img/book31.png)


Long 2 at 501
Sell 2 at 950

Miner just made 889% in the trade, and is up $1690! and with no risk! 





miners only have the power to chose one side of a double spent.    

only solve 



> Decentralized liquity is impossible, becuase of front running.  

## A Possible Solution

### Aprouch 
Attracking the liquidity providers, the Alpha traders
solve the biggest problems of centralized exchanges

#### HFT creates Flash Crashes 
Although Investors and Exchanges relly on traders for price discovery and liquidity. The High Freaquency Alpha bots are cousing more harm than good. HFT is the main cause of flash crashes to begin with. Exchanges and regulators have been seeking ways to elimate the practice. 


A new decentralized exchange that eliminates HFT, thus removing the Flash Crash epidemic, while still retaining the Alpha "Position" Traders, is a tall order! 


### Inspiration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYr-keVOQ18

We take inspiration from the inventors of linked-timestaming, the precursor to the blockchain. Scott Stornetta and Steward Habor found it impossible to solve the problem of creating immutible digitial records, because anyone all those who had access could change it. And even a group of people in-charge of watching over the data could ultimatly collude. The solution was a "conspiracy so large that every one in the world must be in on it". This inverted the problem, by making the data widely distributed and public. 

### Inverting the problem  
Distributed Order-books are impossible, since there is no way to reach consensus on the order of the transactions. This gives each miner the ability to front-run, and take free money, causing adverse-slection risk to all traders at the exchange, which would kill liquidity and not compete with centralized systems. 

What if we look at this "front-running" as a block-reward? In normal blockchains, miner need to be incentivised with block-rewards. However, what if we make a new blockchain, where miners would have to pay to sign blocks? What are they paying for? They are paying for the right to re-order the blocks. 

We invert the problem of front-running, by making it a feature awarded to the highest bidder of each block! From the example above, how much would trader4 pay to go from -$855 to 0? He would pay up to $854. How much would tarder1 pay to NOT go from +855 to 0? He may pay up to $844! 

> invert the problem, by explictly letting anyone pay to front-run

## Reality Arbitrage 

Say this is the list and order of transactions for a block. 

How much would Trader1 pay to reorder blocks? The amount that he lost. 

How much would Trader2 pay to reorder blocks? The amount that he won. 

We called this Dimention or Reality Arbitrage, since you can change the past to a new reality. 

Implications. remove flash crash. remove hft? 

It took hundreds of years until every since drop of Alpha has been squeezed out of centralized exchanges, where HFT rules, and flash crashes are inevitable. 

> What is the new Alpha trading strategy with Reality Arbitrage in effect?  

If we are going to solve the DEX issues, it will have to be the blockchain way, a complete new paradigm for financial markets and exchanges. A new blockchain where you pay sign blocks, and the highest bidder gets to reorder the transactions, with the longest chain being the total cost of the chain. Does this seem like something that should be expored in more depth? Please contact me me via email or twitter to explore this idea even farther. Happy 2019!
