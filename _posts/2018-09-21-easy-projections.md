In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin software, and anyone who downloaded and ran the software would start earning free bitcoin! 

> I would tell everyone I met to run bitcoin software. "Free Money" I said. But they just looked at me like I was crazy. One day at a friends apartment, I forced him to download and run bitcoin on his gaming computer.
>
> 8 years later I received a call from that friend. He wanted me to confirm is he really has 25 bitcoins. He was amazed when I told hi **"Not only is it real, but they are now worth $500,000!"**

###There is a short period of time in any blockchain where early adopters get paid like startup founders!  

With blockchain, the rule of thumb is to *"jump in first, and ask question later"*, as long as the software is open source, and you are not asked to provide any id or email address, and you are not asked for money. 

**This is where we are now with Protoblock and Fantasybit**
