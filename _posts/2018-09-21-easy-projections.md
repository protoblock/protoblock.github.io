In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin software. All you needed to do was download and the software, and you would start earning bitcoin. 

When I would tell my friends and collegues to run bitcoin software, they looked at me like I was crazy! Until this one time, I was in a collegues apartment and forced him to download and run bitcoin on his gaming computer.   
Tim gives me a call, 8 years later, asking me to confirm that he has 25 "real" bitcoin, and that they are now worth 500 thousanda dollars! True Story! 

>There is a short period of time in any blockchain where early adopters get paid like sillicon valley startu founders!
