In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin software, and anyone that would download and run the software, would start earning free bitcoin! I would tell everyone I met to run bitcoin software. "Free Money" I said. But they just looked at me like I was crazy. Until one time, I was in a friends apartment and forced him to download and run bitcoin on his gaming computer. 

### 8 years later, my friends gives me a call to confirm that he really has 25 bitcoin on his computer, and is amazed when I tell hime the good news. His coins are now worth **$500,000**! True Story!

**This is where we are now with Fantasybit**

In general, with blockchain the rule is to _jump in first, and ask question later_  
do this as long as:
* you are not asked for money 
* you dont need to provide identification
* it does not require an email address 
* you are not required to setup a login/password 
* software is open source
