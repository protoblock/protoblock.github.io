In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin software, and anyone that would download and run the software, would start earning free bitcoin! 

> I would tell everyone I met to run bitcoin software. "Free Money" I said. But they just looked at me like I was crazy. Until one time, I was in a friends apartment and forced him to download and run bitcoin on his gaming computer.
>
> 8 years later, my friends gives me a call to confirm if he really has 25 bitcoin. He is amazed when I tell him the good news. **Yes he has real bitcoin, and they are now worth $500,000!** True Story.

#### There is a short period of time in any blockchain where early adopters get paid like startup founders!  
**This is where we are now with Fantasybit** 

With blockchain, the rule of thumb is to *"jump in first, and ask question later"*, as long as the software is open source, and you are not asked to provide any id or email address, and you are not asked for money.
