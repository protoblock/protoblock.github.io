In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin software, and anyone that would download and run the software, would start earning free bitcoin! 

> I would tell everyone I met to run bitcoin software. "Free Money" I said. But they just looked at me like I was crazy. Until one time, I was in a friends apartment and forced him to download and run bitcoin on his gaming computer.   
> 8 years later, my friends gives me a call to confirm that he really has 25 bitcoin on his computer, and is amazed when I tell hime the good news. **Yes he has real bitcoin, and they are now worth $500,000!** True Story.
