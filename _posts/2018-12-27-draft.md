Decentralized Exchanges are a hot topic in the blockchain community. Many are touting them as the ultimate solution to enable global bitcoinization. With so many "DEX" projects coming on-line, lets first ask: what is a "DEX"? Its a Decentralized Exchange. So, what is an exchange? 

# Exchange 
Say you are interested in buying Altcoin with ticker $ALT. Your are  interest in owning $ALT itself, as an investor or user. In contrast to a trader, who does not care about owning $ALT, but is just trading to earn more profits in Bitcoin. We will get to the trader in a bit. 

You are holding Bitcoin and want to purchase Altcoin, the price ticker is $ALTBTC. To do this, you need to go find someone holding $ALT that wants bitcoin, and is willing to sell it to you. You can put adds on craigslist, ask friends, post on social media. Better yet, what if there is a central place where everyones goes that wants to trade $ALTBTC? An Exchange, is like a marketplace, a physical or virtual place where like minded people go to buy or sell Altcoin.
