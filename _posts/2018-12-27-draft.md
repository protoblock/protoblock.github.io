Decentralized Exchanges are a hot topic in the blockchain community. Many are touting them as the ultimate solution to enable global bitcoinization. With so many _DEX_ projects coming on-line, lets first ask: What is a _DEX_? Its a Decentralized Exchange. So, What is an exchange? 

# Exchange 
Say you are interested in buying Altcoin with ticker _$ALT_. Your are  interestested in owning _$ALT_ itself, as an investor or user. In contrast to a trader, who does not care about owning _$ALT_, but is just trading to earn more profits in Bitcoin. We will get to the trader in a bit. 

You are holding Bitcoin and want to purchase Altcoin, the price ticker is _$ALTBTC_. To do this, you need to go find someone holding _$ALT_ that wants bitcoin, and is willing to sell it to you. You can put adds on craigslist, ask friends, and post on social media. Better yet, what if there is a central place where everyones goes that wants to trade _$ALTBTC_? 

**An Exchange, is like a marketplace, a physical or virtual place where like minded people go to buy or sell Altcoin.**

One of the earliest "exchanges" was the Tontine Coffee House in New York City, in the late 1700s, which later became the New York Stock Exchange. Even at a designated exchange, finding a seller with the right quantity and price can take all day, days, weeks or months. Brokers saw a business opportunity, where for a commission, they will stay at the exchange all-day - every day and watch the markets for you. 

Bucket-Shops were are new kind of "exchange" where you can bet on stock prices, but never actuality did any buying or selling at all. One of the most successful speulators of all-time, Jesse Lauriston Livermore, began trading at bucket shops, before becoming a professional wall street traders and speculator.  The book, [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf), is a fictional account of his life, and is a must read for anyone interested in the art of trading and speculation. 

## Traders vs Investors  / Alpha vs Beta
Traders, speculators, and market-makers will buy and sell any asset for the sole purpose of profiting by buying low and selling high. In one sense, traders get paid for providing liquidity to the true buyers, the investors or users. Advanced trading strategies emerged such as "short selling", where a trader would borrow stock from a broker, and then immediately sell it and hold on to the cash.  They would then wait for the price to drop, use some of the cash to buy it back, return the stock to the lender, and keep the remaining cash as profit! 

Investors are seeking liquidity, and traders are seeking profit, and neither one wants to take on the risk that the other side of the trade will default or reneg. Hence the modern financial markets were born. 

Exchanges would match buyers and sellers and create a single "book" of liquidity, while charging an exchange fee for each trade in return for guaranteeing settlement and clearing. They achieved this by only allowing pre-qualified members of the exchange trade. These members would consist of mostly two groups, investment brokers and floor traders.  

Beta is the returns from market movement of the underlying asset itself, while Alpha is the excessive returns that are independent of the underlying market price. Alpha relects you net profit and loss from trading. Beta reflects your profit and loss in relation to an underlying asset. So an investment portfolio with 100% $ALT, has a Beta of 1 vs $ALT. 

Exchanges volumes have always been dominated by traders over investors. By the 80s and 90s, due to computer trading, the internet, and day-traders, 90% of all volume was coming from traders, with only 10% from investors.  High-Frequency-Tradin, or "stat-arb" ,took this to the next level. Today, "Alpha" traders make up to 99% of all trading activity. HFT activity alone, went from 10% of volume in in 2000 to 80% in 2017! [source](https://www.techstars.com/content/startup-digest/history-high-frequency-trading-hft-infographic/)

Modern exchanges cater to both the Beta investor and the Alpha traders, by providing a "central limit order book", a single book of liquidity sorted first by price and then by time. Creating a fair open efficient market, for optimal price discovery.   

Exchanges provide:
* Custody: Settlement and Clearing of trades, plus transfer of assets. This removes the need for buyers and sellers to trust eachother.  
* Liquidity: Matching and Execution of trades, through a single central limit order book. This pools liquity from Alpha traders as well as investors, enabling best prive execution and price discovery.
